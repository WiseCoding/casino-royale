# Casine Royal 🎲

[**Latest Version 👀**](https://wisecoding.github.io/casino-royale/)

# Assignment 📝

> We are a young enterprise and for the past 4 years we have been planning to
> open a casino in Atlantic City (New Jersey) called Casino Royale (yes, like
> the James Bond movie!). The casino is fully built, but unfortunately because
> of a shortage of paper to make playing cards we cannot open to the public.
> While we wait for our suppliers to deliver the cards we need, we decided to go
> online with a virtual casino. We need you to help us achieve our dream!

## _Must-have features_

- The virtual casino will host 2-4 games
- The home page has, for each game, a "card" that will link to it
- From the games I can always go back to the home page, or directly to one of the other games
- The full description of each game is found here
- The whole website must have a coordinated design/image (don't use saturated reds and square corners on one page, but pastel colors and rounded corners on another)
- MUST HAVE GAMES: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock and Twenty-One

## _Nice-to-have features_

- The score (number of games won, per single game and total) is saved and displayed on subsequent page reloads. Give 100 points for each game won. Give 1 point for each second the user remained alive in time-based games.
- See also the "Nice-to-have" section in each game's README.
- NICE TO HAVE GAMES: Memory game (hard) and Moving block game (very hard)
